# 🖥️ Welcome to My VSD-HDP Journey!  

### 🚀 About This Repository
This repository captures my **week-by-week progress** in the **VSD-HDP program**, documenting tasks, experiments, and milestones achieved throughout the journey.  

> *In this program, participants learn to design a complete System-on-Chip (SoC) from RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. It is part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering thousands of participants to design and fabricate silicon while advancing the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.*
